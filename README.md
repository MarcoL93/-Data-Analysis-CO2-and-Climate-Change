# [Data Analysis] CO2 and Climate change

Thanks to the data collected by ourworldindata.org we make an analysis of CO2 emissions and the effects on the temperature of the planet.
We are going to consider specifically which are the areas of the planet where we pollute more, trying to understand why and if there are prospects for a green transition.

Climate warming is a topic of great importance, which is why I chose it as the subject of my portfolio project.
